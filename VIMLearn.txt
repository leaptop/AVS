By default ubuntu doesn't have root user(su or super user) But you should type sudo before commands to tell the computer, that you are a "super user". Or yu can imitate the super user rejime by typing sudo -i. If you want to create a password for root, type: sudo password root. You shouldn't forget the password. To exit the su regime type: exit.
